    "\n",
    "4. **Versatility:** While not primarily used for performance-intensive programming, Python is well-suited for applications like data science and web development, finding applications in healthcare, finance, VFX, and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Beginner-Friendly:** Python is often considered an ideal language for beginners due to its use of English words, strict rules about whitespace, and concise code compared to other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Usage Growth:** Python's usage has seen significant growth since its 1.0 release in 1991, surpassing other major languages in Stack Overflow question views since 2012.\n",

    "## Compiled vs Interpreted Languages\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of programming languages, a fundamental distinction is made between compiled and interpreted languages. This distinction refers to the way a program is executed and translated into machine code. Let's explore the key differences between these two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiled Languages - Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled languages undergo a separate compilation phase before execution. The entire source code is translated into machine code by a compiler, producing an executable file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Generally, compiled languages are more efficient in terms of runtime performance.\n",
    "- **Distribution:** Executable files can be distributed without revealing the source code.\n",
    "- **Examples:** C, C++, Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreted Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages are executed line by line or statement by statement by an interpreter during runtime. The source code is not translated into machine code before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portability:** Code can be run on any system with the corresponding interpreter.\n",
    "- **Debugging:** Easier to debug due to the ability to execute code interactively.\n",
    "- **Examples:** Python, JavaScript, Ruby\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiled Language Example: C\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",

    "    return 0;\n",

    "## Is Python Compiled or Interpreted?\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, python is considered an interpreted language. It depends upon the implementation of python. There are two well known implementations of python \n",
    "\n",
    "- CPython - Most commonly used implementation of python. It is written in C and is the default implementation of python. It is an interpreter.\n",
    "- PyPy    - It is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of python. It is written in RPython and is a just-in-time compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CPython\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compilation/Interpretation:**\n",
    "- CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of Python.\n",
    "- It follows the traditional interpretation approach where Python source code is first translated into intermediate bytecode, and then the bytecode is executed by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Model:**\n",
    "- The CPython interpreter executes Python code in a step-by-step manner, interpreting each line as it encounters it.\n",
    "- Dynamic typing and late binding are core features, providing flexibility but potentially impacting performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance:**\n",
    "- CPython's interpretation model and Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit its performance, especially in scenarios involving CPU-bound tasks and parallel processing.\n",
    "- Extensions written in C can be used to improve performance in critical sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyPy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compilation/Interpretation:**\n",
    "- PyPy takes a different approach by utilizing a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.\n",
    "- It first translates Python source code into an intermediate representation (IR) and then dynamically compiles this IR into machine code at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Model:**\n",
    "- PyPy's JIT compilation allows it to generate optimized machine code, potentially providing faster execution compared to CPython for certain workloads.\n",
    "- The JIT compilation adapts to the runtime behavior of the code, optimizing frequently executed paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance:**\n",
    "- PyPy is known for its improved performance, especially in scenarios involving computationally intensive tasks.\n",
    "- It effectively addresses some of the performance limitations associated with CPython's traditional interpretation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "- CPython's interpretation model can result in slower execution for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "- PyPy's JIT compilation offers performance improvements, making it a compelling choice for certain use cases.\n",
    "- CPython's wide adoption and extensive standard library make it suitable for various applications.\n",
    "- PyPy, while offering performance advantages, may have compatibility issues with certain CPython extensions.\n",

    "### Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a core concept in programming that allow you to organize your code into logical blocks of code that can be reused. Functions are useful for executing a block of code multiple times, with different inputs each time. In this section, we'll explore the basics of functions in Python. A Function has a name, parameters, and a body. The body of the function is indented, just like conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses `()`. The body of the function is indented below the function definition. Let's look at an example of a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. The indentation level of a line of code determines which block it belongs to. The standard indentation in Python is four spaces. Let's look at an example of indentation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 5 > 2:\n",
    "    print(\"Five is greater than two!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `print()` statement is indented below the `if` statement. This indicates that the `print()` statement is part of the `if` block. If the `print()` statement was not indented, it would not be part of the `if` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a function is defined, it can be called or invoked to execute the code inside the function body. To call a function, simply write the function name followed by parentheses `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet()  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returning Values from a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can optionally return a value to the caller using the `return` keyword. The return value can then be used for further processing. Let's look at an example of a function that returns a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- If `input_float` is not a float, the error message should be \"input_float must be a float.\"\n",
